Global â€“ System Utilities & AI Extensions
Overview

Global is a central collection of system utilities, scripts, and AI-powered extensions designed to support the Omniscient framework and other modular projects.

This repo serves as:

A toolbox of scripts and utilities for Linux systems.

A global namespace for shared modules between projects.

A staging area for experimental AI, OSINT, and DevOps workflows.

Features

ðŸ›  Cross-project utilities â€“ shared helpers for Omniscient and related repos.

ðŸ¤– AI Extensions â€“ portable modules for Hugging Face, LangChain, and Ollama integration.

ðŸ“¦ Installers â€“ system-wide and per-user setup scripts.

ðŸ§° Tooling hub â€“ bash, Python, and mixed-language scripts for forensics, monitoring, and automation.

âš¡ Suggested /docs/ expansion:

docs/installation.md â€“ advanced install paths

docs/usage.md â€“ detailed examples

docs/modules.md â€“ shared utilities explained

docs/roadmap.md â€“ feature pipeline

Do you want me to generate a unified documentation style so both Omniscient and global have the same structure/voice (README + /docs folder), or should I keep them distinct since they serve different purposes?
